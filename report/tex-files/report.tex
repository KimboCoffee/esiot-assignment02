	\begin{abstract}
		The main goal of this project is to realize a Smart Waste Disposal Container. It will be based on an Arduino UNO Board linked to a computer via serial communication. In this system, some hardware devices will be dedicated to user interaction, opening or closing the container, or exchanging some basic information via a screen. Then, a subsystem will be dedicated to waste monitoring, revealing when the container is too full or its content is too hot, blocking user interaction. To solve these problems, an operator will have to intervene via the computer to empty the container or to signal that the temperature situation is now under control.

	\chapter{Domain Analysis}
	The domain analysis, working on an embedded system, can be conducted on two levels: hardware and software.
	
	\section{Hardware}
	Besides the main container, which is by no means an active hardware device, some main components can be highlighted from a functional standpoint:
	
	\subsection{User Detector}
	The user detector has the main function of revealing when a user is nearby. This is needed to wake the system from low power consumption mode when a potential user approaches the system.\newline
	It is realized with an infrared passive sensor (PIR), whose functioning is based on infrared variations in the environment. These devices, powered with a tension, return a digital output on a pin when they detect abrupt infrared variations. In \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/}{the variant used} for this project, there are two knobs on the back to regulate sensitivity and delay time, two key factors to detect changes. Due to the fact that these devices work on variations of infrared instead of absolute values, a calibration time on system startup has to be taken into account.
