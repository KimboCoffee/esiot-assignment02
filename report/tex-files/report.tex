		The main goal of this project is to realize a Smart Waste Disposal Container. It will be based on an Arduino UNO Board linked to a computer via serial communication. In this system, some hardware devices will be dedicated to user interaction, opening or closing the container, or exchanging some basic information via a screen. Then, a subsystem will be dedicated to waste monitoring, revealing when the container is too full or its content is too hot, blocking user interaction. To solve these problems, an operator will have to intervene via the computer to empty the container or to signal that the temperature situation is now under control.
